Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.
Each number is given in array format:  as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.  For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] 
represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.  A number arr in array format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1.
Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.

Input Description:
First line contains N,M. (1<N,M<100)
Second lines contains, N elements of integers in array1.
Third lines contains, M elements of integers in array2.

Output Description:
Print the array after adding them together in base -2.

Sample Input:
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1

Sample Output:
1 0 0 0 0

Explanation:
Adding both arrays after converting them into base -2, we get 1 0 0 0 0
